Javascript - tips!
**************************
var| has a global scope

function myfunction(){

var myVariable = 33;

if(true){

myVariable does exist here.

}

}
**************************
let| has block scope

if(true){

let i = 33;

}
let i does not exist down here.

constants can't be reasigned but on objects, the internal values can be changed.
